# Plaga-Dark-icon-theme

Dark icon theme, based on WhiteSur-Dark.
This is an extension of the WhiteSur icon theme, so you'll need
to install both themes.

## Differences from White Sur

0. More icons. Some icons were fixed or redrawed to fit general style.
1. No unnecessary Apple branding. It was replaced with Tux logo.
2. Full ompatibility with dark colour scheme.

## Installation

**Important!** Be sure to install
[WhiteSur-Dark icon theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-icon-theme) first.

### Manual installation from the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlagaMedicum/Plaga-Dark-icon-theme.git ~/.local/share/icons/Plaga-Dark
```

Then go the Appearance settings and choose Plaga-Dark icon theme.

## TODO

- Make Tux logo more distinguishable for low-res.
- Fix colours and styles of some symbolic and low-res icons.
- Fix icons that are not inhereting from WhiteSur and replaced with other resolutions.
- Fix some little issues in high-res icons.
- Change resolutions of some icons (mostly in apps/scalable).
